## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Connection Failed" Errors
- **Cause**: Backend not deployed or wrong URL
- **Fix**: Deploy to Railway, update NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL

#### "Transport: polling" Instead of WebSocket
- **Cause**: Firewall/proxy blocking WebSockets
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Normal, long polling works fine

#### Players Can't Join Game
- **Check**: Game code entered correctly (6 characters)
- **Check**: Game not already started
- **Check**: Names not duplicated

#### Real-time Updates Not Working
- **Check**: Both frontend and backend deployed
- **Check**: Environment variables set correctly
- **Check**: Browser console for connection errors

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### What to Watch For
- **Connection Count**: Should handle 30+ users
- **Response Time**: <100ms for real-time updates  
- **Memory Usage**: Server <100MB for 30 users
- **Error Rate**: <1% connection failures

### Browser Console Monitoring
```javascript
// Expected messages:
"Socket.io client connected successfully"
"Transport: websocket" // or "polling"
"Game created: ABC123"
"Poll results updated"
```

### Server Logs (Railway)
```
Socket.io server running on port 3001
User connected: socket-id
Game created with code: ABC123
Poll ABC123 started
```
